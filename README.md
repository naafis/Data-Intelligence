### Task 1
A large bank has asked us to evaluate the marketing algorithms they use for retail banking. Their sophisticated phone 
marketing algorithm predicts whether a certain person will subscribe to a term deposit or not. Based on that 
assessment, the bank then optimises its phone calling strategy. With this algorithm, the bank has been successful in 
predicting which clients are more likely to subscribe to their term deposits. 

Management is now interested in finding out how a classification model can lead to certain decision-making processes. 

- Create a classification model in Python. Feel free to use libraries such as SkLearn, Keras/Tensorflow or Pytorch. 
- Analyse the model and provide insight into which features/variables influence the outcome of the classification the most: on a global level, and specifically for observation #4 and #20.
- Develop some form of plot or graph with brief comments on your observations. 

Heads up! Jakob left you a voice message to help you with this task.

 
“Hi there,

Thanks for helping with the task. And don’t worry too much about the performance of the model. What’s important is that 
you create a classification model and that you try to evaluate the relevance of potential features, both on a global 
and a local level.

Getting familiar with the Lime and SHAP libraries will help.

Thanks and catch you later.”
