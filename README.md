### Task 1
A large bank has asked us to evaluate the marketing algorithms they use for retail banking. Their sophisticated phone 
marketing algorithm predicts whether a certain person will subscribe to a term deposit or not. Based on that 
assessment, the bank then optimises its phone calling strategy. With this algorithm, the bank has been successful in 
predicting which clients are more likely to subscribe to their term deposits. 

Management is now interested in finding out how a classification model can lead to certain decision-making processes.
